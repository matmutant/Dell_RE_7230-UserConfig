# Making the PN720R Active pen pressure sensitivity work
##  
[not properly working as of 2024-04-25]
PN720R active pen works quite well on the 7230 (although depending on the language of the datasheet it written it is only compatible wth 7220, or with both...), but at first I thought that pressure sensitivity wasn't working at all.
In fact it works in at least 3 apps : native notepad, native screen capture app and in [Kenneth Evans VS-PenInfo](https://github.com/KennethEvans/VS-PenInfo) tool that shows the tablet correctly registering 0000 to 1024 pressure levels.

As read scattered on the internet, GIMP need "Wintab" by N-Trig which is not provided anymore.
Wintab can be found from microsoft in the archive section of the Surface Pro [downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498) :
